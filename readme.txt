IMPORTANT: Before running the website by clicking on "index.html," the user should run the API that I created using Python.
The libraries that are necessary for running the API are FastAPI (pip install fastapi) and Uvicorn (pip install uvicorn).
To run the API the user should run the command prompt and navigate to the folder where the "main.py" file is located,
and then enter the command "uvicorn main:app --reload" to run the API. The API is called in the "Special Offers" page.
The offer data is stored in the "offers.json" file, which is in the same folder.
